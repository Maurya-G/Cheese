                <h2>Curdling</h2>
                <p>A required step in cheesemaking is separating the milk into solid curds and liquid whey. 
                Usually this is done by acidifying (souring) the milk and adding rennet. The acidification can 
                be accomplished directly by the addition of an acid, such as vinegar, in a few cases (paneer, 
                queso fresco). More commonly starter bacteria are employed instead which convert milk sugars 
                into lactic acid. The same bacteria (and the enzymes they produce) also play a large role in 
                the eventual flavor of aged cheeses. Most cheeses are made with starter bacteria from the 
                <em>Lactococcus</em>, <em>Lactobacillus</em>, or <em>Streptococcus</em> families.</p>
                
                <p>Some fresh cheeses are curdled only by acidity, but most cheeses also use rennet. Rennet sets 
                the cheese into a strong and rubbery gel compared to the fragile curds produced by acidic coagulation 
                alone. It also allows curdling at a lower acidity—important because flavor-making bacteria are inhibited 
                in high-acidity environments. In general, softer, smaller, fresher cheeses are curdled with a greater 
                proportion of acid to rennet than harder, larger, longer-aged varieties.</p>

                <h2>Curd Processing</h2>
                <p>At this point, the cheese has set into a very moist gel. Some soft cheeses are now essentially complete: 
                they are drained, salted, and packaged. For most of the rest, the curd is cut into small cubes. This allows 
                water to drain from the individual pieces of curd. Some hard cheeses are then heated to temperatures in the 
                range of 35–55 <abbr title="Celcius">°C</abbr> (95–131 <abbr title="Fahrenheit">°F</abbr>). This forces more 
                whey from the cut curd. It also changes the taste of the finished cheese, affecting both the bacterial culture 
                and the milk chemistry.</p>
                
                <p>Salt has roles in cheese besides adding a salty flavor. It preserves cheese from spoiling, draws moisture 
                from the curd, and firms cheese's texture in an interaction with its proteins. Some cheeses are salted from the 
                outside with dry salt or brine washes. Most cheeses have the salt mixed directly into the curds.</p>
                
                <p>Most cheeses achieve their final shape when the curds are pressed into a mold or form. The harder the cheese, 
                the more pressure is applied. The pressure drives out moisture—the molds are designed to allow water to escape—and 
                unifies the curds into a single solid body.</p>

                <h1 id="Ripening">Ripening</h1>
                <p>A newborn cheese is usually salty yet bland in flavor and, for harder varieties, rubbery in texture. These qualities 
                are sometimes enjoyed—cheese curds are eaten on their own—but normally cheeses are left to rest under controlled 
                conditions. This aging period (also called ripening, or, from the French, <i>affinage</i>) lasts from a few days to 
                several years. As a cheese ages, microbes and enzymes transform texture and intensify flavor. This transformation is 
                largely a result of the breakdown of casein proteins and milkfat into a complex mix of amino acids, amines, and fatty 
                acids.</p>
