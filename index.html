      <p><strong>Cheese</strong> is a dairy product derived from milk that is produced in a wide 
      range of flavors, textures, and forms by coagulation of the milk protein casein. It comprises 
      proteins and fat from milk, usually the milk of cows, buffalo, goats, or sheep. During production, 
      the milk is usually acidified, and adding the enzyme rennet causes coagulation. The solids are 
      separated and pressed into final form. Some cheeses have molds on the rind, the outer layer, or 
      throughout. Most cheeses melt at cooking temperature.</p>
      
      <p>Over a thousand types of cheese from various countries are produced. Their styles, textures 
      and flavors depend on the origin of the milk (including the animal's diet), whether they have 
      been pasteurized, the butterfat content, the bacteria and mold, the processing, and aging. 
      Herbs, spices, or wood smoke may be used as flavoring agents. Other ingredients may be added to 
      some cheeses, such as black pepper, garlic, chives or cranberries.</p>
      
      <p>For a few cheeses, the milk is curdled by adding acids such as vinegar or lemon juice. Most 
      cheeses are acidified to a lesser degree by bacteria, which turn milk sugars into lactic acid, 
      then the addition of rennet completes the curdling. Vegetarian alternatives to rennet are available; 
      most are produced by fermentation of the fungus <em>Mucor miehei</em>, but others have been extracted 
      from various species of the <em>Cynara</em> thistle family.</p>
      
      <p>Cheese is valued for its portability, long life, and high content of fat, protein, calcium, and 
      phosphorus. Cheese is more compact and has a longer shelf life than milk, although how long a cheese 
      will keep depends on the type of cheese. The long storage life of some cheeses, especially when 
      encased in a protective rind, allows selling when markets are favorable. Vacuum packaging of 
      block-shaped cheeses and gas-flushing of plastic bags with mixtures of carbon dioxide and nitrogen 
      are used for storage and mass distribution of cheeses in the 21st century.</p>
