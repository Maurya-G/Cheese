            <p>There are many types of cheese, with around 500 different varieties recognized by the International Dairy 
            Federation.The varieties may be grouped or classified into types according to criteria such as length of ageing, 
            texture, methods of making, fat content, animal milk, country or region of origin, etc.â€”with these criteria either 
            being used singly or in combination, but with no single method being universally used. The method most commonly and 
            traditionally used is based on moisture content, which is then further discriminated by fat content and curing or 
            <a href="Processing.html#Ripening">ripening<a> methods.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Moisture content (soft to hard)</strong> Categorizing cheeses by firmness is a common but inexact practice. 
            The lines between "soft", "semi-soft", "semi-hard", and "hard" are arbitrary, and many types of cheese are made in 
            softer or firmer variations. The main factor that controls cheese hardness is moisture content, which depends largely 
            on the pressure with which it is packed into molds and aging time.</p>

            <p><strong>Fresh, whey and stretched curd cheeses</strong> The main factor in the categorization of these cheeses is 
            their age. Fresh cheeses without additional preservatives can spoil in a matter of days.</p>

            <p><strong>Content (double cream, goat, ewe and water buffalo)</strong> Some cheeses are categorized by the source of the 
            milk used to produce them or by the added fat content of the milk from which they are produced. While most of the world's 
            commercially available cheese is made from cows' milk, many parts of the world also produce cheese from goats and sheep.</p>

            <p><strong>Soft-ripened and blue-vein</strong> There are at least three main categories of cheese in which the presence of 
            mold is a significant feature: soft ripened cheese, washed-rind cheese, and blue cheese.</p>

            <p><strong>Processed cheeses</strong> Processed cheese is made from traditional cheese and emulsifying salts, often with the 
            addition of milk, more salt, preservatives, and food coloring. It is inexpensive, consistent, and melts smoothly. It is sold packaged and 
            either pre-sliced or unsliced, in a number of varieties. It is also available in aerosol cans in some countries.</p>
