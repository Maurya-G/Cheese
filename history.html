                <h2>Etymology</h2>
                <p>The word cheese comes from Latin <em>caseus</em>, from which the modern word casein is also derived. 
                The earliest source is from the proto-Indo-European root <em>*kwat</em>-, which means "to ferment, become sour". 
                The word cheese comes from <em>chese</em> (in Middle English) and <em>cīese</em> or <em>cēse</em> (in Old English). 
                Similar words are shared by other West Germanic languages—West Frisian <em>tsiis</em>, Dutch <em>kaas</em>, German 
                <em>Käse</em>, Old High German <em>chāsi</em>—all from the reconstructed West-Germanic form <em>*kāsī</em>, which in 
                turn is an early borrowing from Latin.</p>

                <h2>Origins</h2>
                <p>Cheese is an ancient food whose origins predate recorded history. There is no conclusive evidence indicating where 
                cheesemaking originated, whether in Europe, Central Asia or the Middle East, but the practice had spread within Europe 
                prior to Roman times and, according to Pliny the Elder, had become a sophisticated enterprise by the time the Roman 
                Empire came into being.</p>
                
                <p>Earliest proposed dates for the origin of cheesemaking range from around 8000 BCE, when sheep were first domesticated.
                Since animal skins and inflated internal organs have, since ancient times, provided storage vessels for a range of 
                foodstuffs, it is probable that the process of cheese making was discovered accidentally by storing milk in a container 
                made from the stomach of an animal, resulting in the milk being turned to curd and whey by the rennet from the stomach.
                </p>
                
                <p>The earliest evidence of cheesemaking in the archaeological record dates back to 5500 BCE and is found in what is now
                Kujawy, Poland, where strainers coated with milk-fat molecules have been found. Cheesemaking may have begun independently
                of this by the pressing and salting of curdled milk to preserve it. Observation that the effect of making cheese in an 
                animal stomach gave more solid and better-textured curds may have led to the deliberate addition of rennet. Early 
                archeological evidence of Egyptian cheese has been found in Egyptian tomb murals, dating to about 2000 BCE. The earliest
                ever discovered preserved cheese was found in the Taklamakan Desert in Xinjiang, China, and it dates back as early as 
                1615 BCE.</p>
            
                <p>By Roman times, cheese was an everyday food and cheesemaking a mature art. As Romanized populations encountered 
                unfamiliar newly settled neighbors, bringing their own cheese-making traditions, their own flocks and their own 
                unrelated words for cheese, cheeses in Europe diversified further, with various locales developing their own distinctive
                traditions and products. The advancement of the cheese art in Europe was slow during the centuries after Rome's fall. 
                Many cheeses today were first recorded in the late Middle Ages or after—cheeses like Cheddar around 1500, Parmesan in 
                1597, Gouda in 1697, and Camembert in 1791.</p>

                <h2>Modern Era</h2>
                <p>Until its modern spread along with European culture, cheese was nearly unheard of in east Asian cultures, in the 
                pre-Columbian Americas, and only had limited use in sub-Mediterranean Africa, mainly being widespread and popular only 
                in Europe, the Middle East, the Indian subcontinent, and areas influenced by those cultures. But with the spread, first 
                of European imperialism, and later of Euro-American culture and food, cheese has gradually become known and increasingly
                popular worldwide. Factory-made cheese overtook traditional cheesemaking in the World War II era, and factories have been
                the source of most cheese in America and Europe ever since.</p>
